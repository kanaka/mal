# mal - Make a Lisp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kanaka/mal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kanaka/mal)

## Description

**1. Mal is a Clojure inspired Lisp interpreter**

**2. Mal is a learning tool**

Each implementation of mal is separated into
11 incremental, self-contained (and testable) steps that demonstrate
core concepts of Lisp. The last step is capable of self-hosting
(running the mal implementation of mal). See the [make-a-lisp process
guide](process/guide.md).

The make-a-lisp steps are:

* [step0_repl](process/guide.md#step-0-the-repl)
* [step1_read_print](process/guide.md#step-1-read-and-print)
* [step2_eval](process/guide.md#step-2-eval)
* [step3_env](process/guide.md#step-3-environments)
* [step4_if_fn_do](process/guide.md#step-4-if-fn-do)
* [step5_tco](process/guide.md#step-5-tail-call-optimization)
* [step6_file](process/guide.md#step-6-files-mutation-and-evil)
* [step7_quote](process/guide.md#step-7-quoting)
* [step8_macros](process/guide.md#step-8-macros)
* [step9_try](process/guide.md#step-9-try)
* [stepA_mal](process/guide.md#step-a-metadata-self-hosting-and-interop)

Each make-a-lisp step has an associated architectural diagram. That elements
that are new for that step are highlighted in red.
Here is the final architecture once [step A](process/guide.md#stepA)
is complete:

If you are interested in creating a mal implementation (or just
interested in using mal for something) you are welcome to to join our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/CKgnNbJBpF). In addition to the [make-a-lisp
process guide](process/guide.md) there is also a [mal/make-a-lisp
FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) where I attempt to answer some common questions.

## Presentations

Mal was presented publicly for the first time in a lightning talk at
Clojure West 2014 (unfortunately there is no video). See
examples/clojurewest2014.mal for the presentation that was given at the
conference (yes, the presentation is a mal program).

At Midwest.io 2015, Joel Martin gave a presentation on Mal titled
"Achievement Unlocked: A Better Path to Language Learning".
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgyOAiRtZGw),
[Slides](http://kanaka.github.io/midwest.io.mal/).

More recently Joel gave a presentation on "Make Your Own Lisp Interpreter
in 10 Incremental Steps" at LambdaConf 2016:
[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhupfthTEk),
[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5OQBMGpaTU),
[Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mARZzGgX4U),
[Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCO1SYR5kDU),
[Slides](http://kanaka.github.io/lambdaconf/).

## Building/running implementations

The simplest way to run any given implementation is to use docker.
Every implementation has a docker image pre-built with language
dependencies installed. You can launch the REPL using a convenient
target in the top level Makefile (where IMPL is the implementation
directory name and stepX is the step to run):

```
make DOCKERIZE=1 "repl^IMPL^stepX"
    # OR stepA is the default step:
make DOCKERIZE=1 "repl^IMPL"
```

## External / Alternate Implementations

The following implementations are maintained as separate projects:

### HolyC

* [by Alexander Bagnalla](https://github.com/bagnalla/holyc_mal)

### Rust

* [by Tim Morgan](https://github.com/seven1m/mal-rust)
* [by vi](https://github.com/vi/mal-rust-vi) - using [Pest](https://pest.rs/) grammar, not using typical Mal infrastructure (cargo-ized steps and built-in converted tests).

### Swift 2

* [by Keith Rollin](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/fbfe678/impls/swift) - This implementation used to be in the repo. However, Swift 2 is no longer easily buildable/testable.

### Q

* [by Ali Mohammad Pur](https://github.com/alimpfard/mal/tree/q/impls/q) - The Q implementation works fine but it requires a proprietary manual download that can't be Dockerized (or integrated into the mal CI pipeline) so for now it remains a separate project.


## Other mal Projects

 * [malc](https://github.com/dubek/malc) - Mal (Make A Lisp) compiler. Compiles a Mal program to LLVM assembly language, then binary.
 * [malcc](https://github.com/seven1m/malcc) - malcc is an incremental compiler implementation for the Mal language. It uses the Tiny C Compiler as the compiler backend and has full support for the Mal language, including macros, tail-call elimination, and even run-time eval. ["I Built a Lisp Compiler"](https://mpov.timmorgan.org/i-built-a-lisp-compiler/) post about the process.
 * [frock](https://github.com/chr15m/frock) - Clojure-flavoured PHP. Uses mal/php to run programs.
 * [flk](https://github.com/chr15m/flk) - A LISP that runs wherever Bash is
 * [glisp](https://github.com/baku89/glisp) - Self-bootstrapping graphic design tool on Lisp. [Live Demo](https://baku89.com/glisp/)


## Implementation Details

### Ada

The Ada implementation was developed with GNAT 4.9 on debian. It also
compiles unchanged on windows if you have windows versions of git,
GNAT and (optionally) make.  There are no external dependencies
(readline not implemented).

```
cd impls/ada
make
./stepX_YYY
```

### Ada.2

The second Ada implementation was developed with GNAT 8 and links with
the GNU readline library.

```
cd impls/ada
make
./stepX_YYY
```

### GNU awk

The GNU awk implementation of mal has been tested with GNU awk 4.1.1.

```
cd impls/gawk
gawk -O -f stepX_YYY.awk
```

### Bash 4

```
cd impls/bash
bash stepX_YYY.sh
```

### BASIC (C64 and QBasic)

The BASIC implementation uses a preprocessor that can generate BASIC
code that is compatible with both C64 BASIC (CBM v2) and QBasic. The
C64 mode has been tested with
[cbmbasic](https://github.com/kanaka/cbmbasic) (the patched version is
currently required to fix issues with line input) and the QBasic mode
has been tested with [qb64](http://www.qb64.net/).

Generate C64 code and run it using cbmbasic:

```
cd impls/basic
make stepX_YYY.bas
STEP=stepX_YYY ./run
```

Generate QBasic code and load it into qb64:

```
cd impls/basic
make MODE=qbasic stepX_YYY.bas
./qb64 stepX_YYY.bas
```

Thanks to [Steven Syrek](https://github.com/sjsyrek) for the original
inspiration for this implementation.

### BBC BASIC V

The BBC BASIC V implementation can run in the Brandy interpreter:

```
cd impls/bbc-basic
brandy -quit stepX_YYY.bbc
```

Or in ARM BBC BASIC V under RISC OS 3 or later:

```
*Dir bbc-basic.riscos
*Run setup
*Run stepX_YYY
```

### C

The C implementation of mal requires the following libraries (lib and
header packages): glib, libffi6, libgc, and either the libedit or GNU readline
library.

```
cd impls/c
make
./stepX_YYY
```

### C.2

The second C implementation of mal requires the following libraries (lib and
header packages): libedit, libgc, libdl, and libffi.

```
cd impls/c.2
make
./stepX_YYY
```


### C++

The C++ implementation of mal requires g++-4.9 or clang++-3.5 and
a readline compatible library to build. See the `cpp/README.md` for
more details:

```
cd impls/cpp
make
    # OR
make CXX=clang++-3.5
./stepX_YYY
```


### C# ###

The C# implementation of mal has been tested on Linux using the Mono
C# compiler (mcs) and the Mono runtime (version 2.10.8.1). Both are

make
mono ./stepX_YYY.exe
```

### ChucK

The ChucK implementation has been tested with ChucK 1.3.5.2.

```
cd impls/chuck
./run
```

### Clojure

For the most part the Clojure implementation requires Clojure 1.5,
however, to pass all tests, Clojure 1.8.0-RC4 is required.

```
cd impls/clojure
lein with-profile +stepX trampoline run
```

### CoffeeScript

```
sudo npm install -g coffee-script
cd impls/coffee
coffee ./stepX_YYY
```

### Common Lisp

The implementation has been tested with SBCL, CCL, CMUCL, GNU CLISP, ECL and
Allegro CL on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 12.04, see
the [README](impls/common-lisp/README.org) for more details. Provided you have the
dependencies mentioned installed, do the following to run the implementation

```

make
./run
```

### Crystal

The Crystal implementation of mal has been tested with Crystal 0.26.1.

```
cd impls/crystal
crystal run ./stepX_YYY.cr

mvn -quiet exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=mal.stepX_YYY
    # OR
mvn -quiet exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=mal.stepX_YYY -Dexec.args="CMDLINE_ARGS"
```

### Java, using Truffle for GraalVM

This Java implementation will run on OpenJDK, but can run
as much as 30x faster on GraalVM thanks to the Truffle framework.
It's been tested with OpenJDK 11, GraalVM CE 20.1.0, and
GraalVM CE 21.1.0.

```
cd impls/java-truffle
./gradlew build
STEP=stepX_YYY ./run
```

### JavaScript/Node

```

The Julia implementation of mal requires Julia 0.4.

```
cd impls/julia
julia stepX_YYY.jl
```

### jq

Tested against version 1.6, with a lot of cheating in the IO department

```
cd impls/jq
STEP=stepA_YYY ./run
    # with Debug
DEBUG=true STEP=stepA_YYY ./run
```

java -jar stepX_YYY.jar
```

### LaTeX3

The LaTeX3 implementation of mal has been tested with pdfTeX
3.141592653-2.6-1.40.24.

Self hosting is too slow for any sensible timeout, and crashes in
step4, apparently because of hard-coded limitations.

Anybody working on this should uncomment the two lines of (slow)
debugging options in the step file, and export DEBUG=1 (for more
output than tests accept).

implementation requires luarocks to be installed.

```
cd impls/lua
make  # to build and link linenoise.so and rex_pcre.so
./stepX_YYY.lua
```

### Mal

Running the mal implementation of mal involves running stepA of one of
the other implementations and passing the mal step to run as a command
line argument.

```
cd impls/IMPL
IMPL_STEPA_CMD ../mal/stepX_YYY.mal

```

### miniMAL

[miniMAL](https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL) is small Lisp interpreter
implemented in less than 1024 bytes of JavaScript. To run the miniMAL
implementation of mal you need to download/install the miniMAL
interpreter (which requires Node.js).
```
cd impls/miniMAL
# Download miniMAL and dependencies
npm install
export PATH=`pwd`/node_modules/minimal-lisp/:$PATH
# Now run mal implementation in miniMAL
miniMAL ./stepX_YYY
```

### Perl 5

The Perl 5 implementation should work with perl 5.19.3 and later.

Term::ReadLine::Gnu from CPAN.

```
cd impls/perl
perl stepX_YYY.pl
```

### Perl 6

### PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL SQL Procedural Language)

The PL/pgSQL implementation of mal requires a running PostgreSQL server
(the "kanaka/mal-test-plpgsql" docker image automatically starts
a PostgreSQL server). The implementation connects to the PostgreSQL server
and create a database named "mal" to store tables and stored
procedures. The wrapper script uses the psql command to connect to the
server and defaults to the user "postgres" but this can be overridden
with the PSQL_USER environment variable. A password can be specified
using the PGPASSWORD environment variable. The implementation has been
tested with PostgreSQL 9.4.

```
cd impls/plpgsql
./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
    # OR
PSQL_USER=myuser PGPASSWORD=mypass ./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
```

### PL/SQL (Oracle SQL Procedural Language)

The PL/SQL implementation of mal requires a running Oracle DB
server (the "kanaka/mal-test-plsql" docker image automatically
starts an Oracle Express server). The implementation connects to the
Oracle server to create types, tables and stored procedures. The
default SQL\*Plus logon value (username/password@connect_identifier) is
"system/oracle" but this can be overridden with the ORACLE_LOGON
environment variable. The implementation has been tested with Oracle
Express Edition 11g Release 2. Note that any SQL\*Plus connection
warnings (user password expiration, etc) will interfere with the
ability of the wrapper script to communicate with the DB.

```
cd impls/plsql
./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql
    # OR
ORACLE_LOGON=myuser/mypass@ORCL ./wrap.sh stepX_YYY.sql

## Running tests

The top level Makefile has a number of useful targets to assist with
implementation development and testing. The `help` target provides
a list of the targets and options:

```
make help
```

### Functional tests

The are almost 800 generic functional tests (for all implementations)
in the `tests/` directory. Each step has a corresponding test file
containing tests specific to that step. The `runtest.py` test harness
launches a Mal step implementation and then feeds the tests one at
a time to the implementation and compares the output/return value to
the expected output/return value.

* To run all the tests across all implementations (be prepared to wait):

```
make test
```

* To run all tests against a single implementation:

```
make "test^IMPL"

# e.g.
make "test^clojure"
make "test^js"
```

* To run tests for a single step against all implementations:

```
make "test^stepX"

# e.g.
make "test^step2"
make "test^step7"
```

* To run tests for a specific step against a single implementation:

```
make "test^IMPL^stepX"

# e.g
make "test^ruby^step3"
make "test^ps^step4"
```

### Self-hosted functional tests

* To run the functional tests in self-hosted mode, you specify `mal`
  as the test implementation and use the `MAL_IMPL` make variable
  to change the underlying host language (default is JavaScript):
```
make MAL_IMPL=IMPL "test^mal^step2"

# e.g.
make "test^mal^step2"   # js is default
make MAL_IMPL=ruby "test^mal^step2"
make MAL_IMPL=python3 "test^mal^step2"
```

### Starting the REPL

* To start the REPL of an implementation in a specific step:

```
make "repl^IMPL^stepX"

# e.g
make "repl^ruby^step3"
make "repl^ps^step4"
```

* If you omit the step, then `stepA` is used:

```
make "repl^IMPL"

# e.g
make "repl^ruby"
make "repl^ps"
```

* To start the REPL of the self-hosted implementation, specify `mal` as the
  REPL implementation and use the `MAL_IMPL` make variable to change the
  underlying host language (default is JavaScript):
```
make MAL_IMPL=IMPL "repl^mal^stepX"

# e.g.
make "repl^mal^step2"   # js is default
make MAL_IMPL=ruby "repl^mal^step2"
make MAL_IMPL=python3 "repl^mal"
```

### Performance tests

Warning: These performance tests are neither statistically valid nor
comprehensive; runtime performance is a not a primary goal of mal. If
you draw any serious conclusions from these performance tests, then
please contact me about some amazing oceanfront property in Kansas
that I'm willing to sell you for cheap.

* To run performance tests against a single implementation:
```
make "perf^IMPL"

# e.g.
make "perf^js"
```

* To run performance tests against all implementations:
```
make "perf"
```

### Generating language statistics

* To report line and byte statistics for a single implementation:
```
make "stats^IMPL"

# e.g.
make "stats^js"
```

## Dockerized testing

Every implementation directory contains a Dockerfile to create
a docker image containing all the dependencies for that
implementation. In addition, the top-level Makefile contains support
for running the tests target (and perf, stats, repl, etc) within
a docker container for that implementation by passing *"DOCKERIZE=1"*
on the make command line. For example:

```
make DOCKERIZE=1 "test^js^step3"
```

Existing implementations already have docker images built and pushed
to the docker registry. However, if
you wish to build or rebuild a docker image locally, the toplevel
Makefile provides a rule for building docker images:

```
make "docker-build^IMPL"
```


**Notes**:
* Docker images are named *"ghcr.io/kanaka/mal-test-IMPL"*
* JVM-based language implementations (Groovy, Java, Clojure, Scala):
  you will probably need to run this command once manually
  first `make DOCKERIZE=1 "repl^IMPL"` before you can run tests because
  runtime dependencies need to be downloaded to avoid the tests timing
  out. These dependencies are downloaded to dot-files in the /mal
  directory so they will persist between runs.
